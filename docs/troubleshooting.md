# Troubleshooting

First move, always:

```
c2c doctor
```

It checks Node, workspace, bridge, MCP, OAuth and tunnel — and repairs what it
can (restarts the bridge, restarts the tunnel) without asking.

## Common situations

### "Bridge 未运行"
`c2c start` (or let doctor do it). Bridge logs:
`c2c logs`, or verbose: `c2c logs --verbose`.

If doctor says the bridge state is **uncertain** (无法确认), do not start a
second bridge and do not Delete the ChatGPT connector. Wait and run doctor
again. The local process may still be running.

### Everything was quit and ChatGPT can no longer connect
Quitting Codex / the terminal does not by itself prove that the public address
changed. Run a fresh `c2c doctor` and use its structured result. A
`namedRepair` requires the named-tunnel recovery first; a `chatgptRepair`
requires the current supported action for the exact
`chatgptRepair.connectorName`. Reuse a healthy connector and do not pre-decide
Delete, Reconnect or recreation from an old failure pattern. Other workspaces
keep their own connectors so two projects can stay connected at once.

Fixed ChatGPT pages for first-time setup and later repair (do not hunt the UI):

- Developer mode: https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Security
- Plugins hub (manage existing connectors): https://chatgpt.com/plugins
- Add a connector:
  https://chatgpt.com/plugins#settings/Connectors?create-connector=true&redirectAfter=%2Fplugins

### Tunnel URL unreachable / ChatGPT says the connector is broken
Same as above: run `c2c doctor`, verify the exact workspace and follow the
current structured repair action. `chatgptRepair.needed` is not by itself a
blanket instruction to delete every same-named connector. Fresh pairing code:
`c2c pair` only when the current result actually requires re-authorization.
If this workspace uses a stable hostname, doctor sets `namedRepair` instead —
re-login to Cloudflare (`c2c tunnel login`) and doctor again. Do not Delete
the connector; the address did not change.

### I have a Cloudflare domain and want a stable hostname
During first-time setup (or the next coding session, once), say you have a
Cloudflare account and give the domain. Codex opens a browser for Cloudflare
login, then keeps `c2c-<project>.your-domain.com`. To stay on the temporary
address, say you do not have a domain. Switching later: tell Codex you want
the stable hostname; it runs `c2c tunnel choose --mode named --zone <domain>`.

### "配对码无效/过期"
Pairing codes are one-time and expire after ~5 minutes:

```
c2c pair
```

generates a fresh one (older codes become invalid immediately).

### ChatGPT gets 401 on every tool call
A 401 can indicate expired or revoked authentication, but do not infer endpoint
change from the status code alone. Use the current Doctor result and structured
error to distinguish authentication repair from endpoint repair. Re-authorize
only the exact workspace connector when required; recreate it only when current
evidence and authorization require that action.

### cloudflared is not installed
Reuse an existing verified installation when available. If the current setup
request or prior instructions authorize dependency installation, use the
platform's supported package route (macOS: `brew install cloudflared`; Windows:
`winget install Cloudflare.cloudflared`; Linux: Cloudflare's package
instructions). Otherwise report the exact missing dependency and stop that
setup step; setup does not create installation authority.
If cloudflared is installed in a custom location that is not on `PATH`, set
`C2C_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` to the executable's absolute path before running `c2c`.

### Every new Codex chat “repairs” the connection / cannot write logs
The C2C state directory lives outside the project (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/codex-with-chatgpt`; Windows:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\codex-with-chatgpt`). Codex's default sandbox cannot write
there, so each new chat looks like a health-check failure.

`c2c setup`, `c2c doctor` and `c2c sandbox-allow` add that directory to
`[sandbox_workspace_write].writable_roots` in `~/.codex/config.toml`
(`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` on Windows). After that, later chats
do not need elevation.

### Port already in use
Handled automatically: an existing healthy bridge for the same workspace is
reused; anything else makes the bridge pick a free port. Configuration follows
automatically.

### Reading a file returns ACCESS_DENIED_SENSITIVE_FILE
Working as intended: `.env`, keys, credentials and anything matched by
`.c2cignore` are never readable through ChatGPT. `.env.example` is allowed.

### I cannot see Projects in the ChatGPT sidebar
Hover **Chats** /「聊天」, click the … that appears, and choose
**Organize by project** /「按项目整理」. Then create a project named after
this workspace, with **project-only memory**. Tell Codex「好了」when the
collection page is open (`https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-…/project`).

### This workspace opened the wrong ChatGPT Project
Do not pick another project by name automatically. Open the collection that
matches this workspace and tell Codex「已找到」, or say you want the old
long-chat instead. Each workspace has its own Project and its own connector.

### Recovery after a specific diagnosis
Do not treat a slow page or a vague "stuck" report as permission to stop or
rebuild anything. Preserve the error and run identity, obtain a fresh Doctor
result, and follow the recovery workflow for the structured finding. Stop the
precisely owned instance or run setup again only when current evidence shows
that reconstruction is required and current authorization covers it. If state,
ownership or authority is unclear, preserve the existing connection and report
the minimum blocker.
